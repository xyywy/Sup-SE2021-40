Supplementary code asset for "Reflection tomography by depth warping: A case study across the Java trench" on Solid Earth (SE-2021-40) (doi.org/10.5194/se-2021-40).

The scripts and Jupyter Notebooks provide the math impletations of the depth varient displacement correction, and the automatic residual move-out(RMO) tracking.

Python (3.7-3.8), OBSpy (1.2.1-1.2.2), Numpy, and Scipy are needed dependencies before executing the code. The input data directory ("inputdata_withavo") is needed to be placed at the same directory level as the scripts. 

The IPython notebook file (*.ipynb) provides the interactive coding interface of the Python source code (*.py).

We suggested to use the Anaconda to build the Python environment.
