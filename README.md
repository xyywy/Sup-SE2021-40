Supplementary code for "Reflection tomography by depth warping: A case study across the Java trench" on Solid Earth (SE-2021-40) (doi.org/10.5194/se-2021-40).

The IPython notebook file (*.ipynb) provides the interactive coding interface of the Python source code (*.py).

Python (3.7-3.8), OBSpy (1.2.1-1.2.2), Numpy, and Scipy are needed dependencies before executing the code.

We suggested to use the Anaconda to build the Python environment.
